# AI Chess Agent with Minimax Algorithm
## Overview
The primary goal of this project was to create an AI agent capable of playing chess. The agent uses the minimax algorithm to make strategic decisions, simulating a human-like opponent. 
The project involved not only programming the movement logic for standard and custom chess pieces but also incorporating advanced AI techniques to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Features
**Minimax Algorithm:** Implemented the minimax algorithm to evaluate possible game states and choose optimal moves, making the AI competitive against human players.\
**Custom Chess Pieces:** Integrated two special pieces with unique movement patterns, expanding the complexity of the game.\
**Move Validation:** Ensures all moves adhere to chess rules, including special conditions for custom pieces.\
**AI Decision-Making:** The AI agent evaluates potential moves using a game tree, assessing both immediate and long-term outcomes.\

## Key Components
**Minimax Algorithm:** Central to the AI agent's decision-making, the minimax algorithm evaluates the potential moves up to a certain depth, considering the opponent's best possible responses.\
**Custom Piece Logic:** Special pieces like the "Squire" and "Combatant" were added with unique movement and interaction rules, enriching the game's strategic depth.\
**Move Generation and Validation:** Functions were implemented to generate and validate all possible legal moves for both standard and custom pieces.
